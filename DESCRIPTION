Description: This package calculates childhood (neonatal, postneonatal, infant, child, and under-five) mortality rates using DHS microdata.
    The ChildhoodMortality package was developed in accordance to the methodology outlined in the “DHS Guide to Statistics.” 
    Specifically, the package uses a synthetic cohort life table approach, combining mortality probabilities for age segments
    with actual cohort mortality experience into more common age segments. Standard errors for mortality estimates are computed using
    the jackknife repeated replication method outlined in Appendix C of the DHS final reports (Rutstein 2006). This methodology controls for
    sample design.
